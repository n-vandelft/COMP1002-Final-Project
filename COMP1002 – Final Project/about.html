    <h1>Our Journey</h1>
    <p>The Nitendo™ story started in 1889 in Tokyo, Japan with
        <br>our founder (Bill Thompson) and Co-founder (Jon Son).
        <br>Nitendo™ started as a 12 man company that would make simple
        <br> TV shows targeted for young children. With time, the public seemed
        <br> very high on the character"Mario". And there, Nitendo™ decided 
        <br>to attempt this new methood so fans could interact with "Mario".
        <br>There being the first vidio game console. The "Visual Boy"</p>
